This was my exam work for Teknikh√∂gskolan in june 2024.
The goal with this work was to see if you are able to use machine learning to predticted combat losses in warfare.
The first step was the gather the materials needed for the project and I downloaded the data used for machine learning from kaggle and used Petro Ivaniuk dataset
