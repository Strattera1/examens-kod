This was my exam work for Teknikh√∂gskolan in june 2024.
The goal with this work was to see if you are able to use machine learning to preticted  combat losses in warfare.
The first step was the gather the materials needed for the project and I downloaded the data used for machine learning from kaggle and used Petro Ivaniuk dataset
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/piterfm/2022-ukraine-russian-war
In the exam work, I first stated to check the data to see if there were anything that would not add any vaule to the project and would remove it.
I would also test different machine learning models to see which one of them would have the highest accuarcy score and in the end, I picked linear model to train the data.
In conclusion, you could use machine learning to preticted combat losses to some extent, but it can never be 100% accuracy as the human variable is at hand.
